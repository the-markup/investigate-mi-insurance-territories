# How We Investigated Michigan Insurance Territories

This repository contains data and code to reproduce the findings featured in our story "[Michiganâ€™s 'Fair and Reasonable' Reforms Allowed Car Insurers to Charge More in Black Neighborhoods](https://mrkup.org/l5W6g)."

Our methodology is described in "[How We Investigated Car Insurance Loopholes in Michigan](https://mrkup.org/wr1HV)."

We extracted the relevant territory tables from documents submitted to the Office of Insurance Rates and Forms of the Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services.

The code in this repository was used to produce and analyze the data for our investigation. The process is described in detail below for replication and inspection.

# Notebooks

This is a summary of the notebooks in the insurer directories.

## 00(a)-extract-auto-table.ipynb

This notebook extracts territory tables from PDF of insurer filing to produce tabulated data files for analysis.

## 00b-geography-experiment.ipynb

This notebook exists for State Farm and Allstate, the two insurers using custom-made gridded territory maps. It is used to run experiments to determine the optimal geography match for our analysis.

## 01-analysis.ipynb

This notebook replicates and fact checks all the data figures and findings used in publication.

# Data

The data produced for the analysis is stored in each insurer's `outputs/` directory as `INSURER_auto_clean.csv`. For example, `02_allstate/outputs/allstate_auto_clean.csv` for Allstate.

Those files contain the following columns:

# Reproducibility

All notebooks committed have been run and display outputs.

We ran our code in a JupyterLab development environment running in a Docker container. The Docker image is derived from the [Docker Stacks `datascience-notebook` image](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/selecting.html#jupyter-datascience-notebook). 

The dependencies include packages available in the `datascience-notebook` image plus `geopandas` and `tabula-py`. If needed, [install Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to run the container.

Create and start the container by running this command in a terminal:

> docker compose up 

Copy and paste the output web address into an internet browser to open the JupyterLab development environment.
