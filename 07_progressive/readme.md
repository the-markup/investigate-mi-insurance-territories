# Progressive

We did not analyze Progressive’s territory-based rating factors, because we were unable to reliably match its territories to preexisting geographic boundaries. Progressive divided the state into territories labeled using a “location name,” grouped using “territory codes” corresponding to relativities.

# Notebooks

`00b-location-matches.ipynb` has the code and output comparing the geographic names in multiple census data sets. No definitive match is found.

# Data

`territory_image_map/` contains the geographic data files overlaid onto the territory map `MI 202001 AG Territory Map.png` to search for a match to join on census demographic data. No definitive match is found.
